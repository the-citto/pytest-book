# my python testing with pytest

my excercises following [Python Testing with pytest, 2nd Edition](https://pythontest.com/pytest-book/)

`cards`, the simple app to follow along, fully rewritten with `click`instead of `typer` and `SQLite` + `SQLAlchemy` instead of `tynydb`

## CH03
refactored to separate context creations from `cli` module to `api`

too coupled
